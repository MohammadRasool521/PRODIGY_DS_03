Title : Decision Tree Classifier in Bank+Marketing

Overview :
Build a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Use a dataset such as the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

About the Dataset :
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

In this project, I explored the task using a bar chart to understand more deep. My analysis revealed valuable insights into the performance and effectiveness in capturing the variability.

The Decision Tree Classifier project was a valuable learning experience, providing insights into the intricacies of predictive modeling and its knowledge about the Decision Tree. The successful implementation of the demonstrated the potential for data-driven decision-making in optimizing .

Special Thanks to Prodigy InfoTech for this incredible opportunity for gave chance to explore more in this professional development..
